[db2inst1@tds-ldap DB2]$ ./CreateBaseDB.sh 


==================================================

This script will create a new DB2 database to be used as the Content Analyzer Base database and initialize the database.

If you prefer to create your own database, and only want the script to initialize the existing database, please exit this script and run 'InitBaseDB.sh'.

==================================================


Enter the name of the database to create. (The name must be 8 chars or less). If nothing is entered, we will use this default value :  BASECA


We need a non-admin database user that BACA will use to access your BASE database.

Please enter the name of an existing database user with read and write privileges for this database:
